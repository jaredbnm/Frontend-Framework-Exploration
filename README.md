# Frontend-Framework-Exploration

## Project Description

For this project, I built a Pomodoro timer to help users keep track of productivity. Along with the timer, there's a calendar implemented for users to track Pomodoro progress. The calender also helps with overall visualization of time for users to plan accordingly.

As I'm using React for the final project, this site was developed using Vue.js!

To use the site, simply navigate to the Pomodoro page and begin the timer. After 4 Pomodoros, users can take a long break which completes 1 cycle. When using the calendar, you may click on a date to add a session. You can also navigate throughout the calendar to add future sessions or sessions you've already completed. 

The tool is hosted through Azure with the following [link](https://frontend-framework-exploration-btetd4dzfjajgjcq.centralus-01.azurewebsites.net/).
